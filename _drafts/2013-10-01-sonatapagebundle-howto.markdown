Building a small Content Management System with Sonata Page Bundle FTW.

## Pre-requisites

  - have a fresh Symfony 2 installation (see my [article for base Symfony install and setup][Symfony install])

## Why Sonata Page Bundle

Because (as of this writing) :

  - the awaited [Symfony CMF][Symfony CMF] is not production ready, but it's moving very fast.
  - the Sonata bundles suite is well integrated and maintained
