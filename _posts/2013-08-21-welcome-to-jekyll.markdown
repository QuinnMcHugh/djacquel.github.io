Hello World !

I'm switchnig from [Diem / Symfony 1.x][diem] blog to a [Jekyll docs][jekyll] [Github pages][ghpages] powered blog.

And that's why :

-   symfony 1.x is dying as well as Diem, all the community, including me, is now working on [Symfony 2][symfony] and [Symfony CMF][symfonyCMF].
-   for me performance is a must have so static is better than dynamic for my blog.
-   I'm a geek and I'm always in learning mode !


My old posts will not survive the change as they need serious review. I'll probably write new ones about thing like setting up Xdebug with Sublime Text 3 and developer's tools in general.

Happy coding.
