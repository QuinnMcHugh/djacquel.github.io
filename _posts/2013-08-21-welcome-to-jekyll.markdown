Hello World !

I'm switching from [Diem / Symfony 1.x][diem] blog to a [Jekyll docs][jekyll] [Github pages][ghpages] powered blog.

And that's why :

-   symfony 1.x is dying as well as Diem, all the community, including me, is now working on [Symfony 2][symfony] and [Symfony CMF][symfonyCMF].
-   for me performance is a must have, so static is better than dynamic for my blog.
-   I'm a geek and I'm always in learning mode and Jekyll is a good occasion to improve my Ruby knowledge.

My old posts will not survive the change as they are now obsoletes. 
But new ones will be online soon !

Happy coding.
